## Project Description
It is an online platform designed to cater to the needs of international students and house retailers/owners. The platform serves as a central hub where students can find suitable accommodation options and connect with peers from around the world.

## Key Features
* **User Verification:** Both students and house retailers/owners undergo a thorough ID verification process to ensure the safety and authenticity of users.
* **Accommodation Listings:** House retailers/owners can list their properties for rent, specifying details such as location, rent amount, amenities, and more. Students have the flexibility to filter listings based on their preferred university or college range, ensuring that they find accommodations conveniently located near their academic institutions. Also to ensure high-quality listings and fair usage of the platform, house owners are charged a nominal fee for each listing they post.
* **Bidding System:** To make the rental process fair and transparent, a bidding system is implemented where students can place bids on properties they are interested in. The system considers various criteria such as limited-range bidding.
* **Community Forum:** The platform hosts a community forum where students can engage with each other, ask questions, share experiences, and seek advice on various topics related to student life, accommodation, academics, and more.
